### Description:
> A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Lost and Found Information System 1.0. It has been classified as critical. This affects some unknown processing of the file admin/?page=categories/view_category of the component GET Parameter Handler. The manipulation of the argument id with an unknown input leads to a sql injection vulnerability. CWE is classifying the issue as CWE-89. The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. This is going to have an impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
### Proof of Concept:
> Following steps are involved:
1. Visit the vulnerable page: /php-lfis/admin/?page=categories/view_category&id=2
2. Copy request to a txt file and run with SQLmap
